data and variables
----------------------

classification of variables
	categorical:
		binary - 2 categories
		nominal - more categories
		ordinal - order matters

	quantitative:
		discrete - numerical
		continuous - uninterrupted


types of variables
	continuous variables:
		always numeric
		can be any number, positive or negative
		eg: age in years, weight, blood pressure readings, temperature, concentrations of pollutants and other measurements

	categorical variables:
		info that can be sorted into categories
		eg: ordinal, nomminal and dichotomous (binary)


ordinal variables:
	a categorical variable with some intrinsic order or numeric value
	ordered categories
	relative rankings
	unknown distance between rankings
	zero is arbitrary
	eg: education (no high school degree, hs degree, some college, college degree)
	    agreement (strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, strongly agree)
	    rating (excellent, good, fair, poor)
	    frequency (always, often, sometimes, never)
	    any other scale ("on a scale of 1 to 5....")
	    likert scales (1=low, 2=middle, 3=high)
	    socioeconomic status (1=small, 2=medium, 3=large)


nominal variables:
	a categorical variable without an intrinsic order
	lowest level of measurement
	discrete categories
	no natural order
	categorical or binary
	may be referred to a qualitative or categorical
	eg: where a person lives in the u.s. (northeast, south, midwest, etc)
	    sex
	    nationality (american, mexican, french)
	    race/ethnicity (african american, hispanis, white, asian american)
	    favourite pet (dog, cat, fish, snake)
	    role in the class (0=student, 1=lecturer)
	    group membership (1=experimental, 2=placebo, 3=routine)
	    marital status
	    type of car


binary/boolean variables:
	a categorical variable with only 2 levelsof categories
	often represents the answer to a yes or no question
	eg: "did you attend the church pinic on may 24?"
	    "did you eat potato salad at the picnic?"


coding:
	process of trnaslating information gathered from questionnaires or other sources into something that can be analysed
	involves assigning a value to the information given - often value is given a label
	coding can make data more consistent:
		eg: question = wear glasses
		    answers = yes, no, never, always
		coding will avoid such inconsistencies


coding systems:
	common coding systems (code and label) for binary variables:
		0=no, 1=yes (1 is value assigned, yes is label of value)
	when you assign a value you must also make it clear what that value means
	you can make it clear by creating a data dictionary to accompany the dataset


coding: dummy variables
	a "dummy" variable is any variable that is coded to have 2 levels (yes/no, dog/cat, etc)
	may be used to represent more complicated variables
		eg: # of cigarettes smoked per week - answer total 75 responses ranging from 0 cigarettes to 3 packs per week
		    can be recorded as a dummy variable: 1=smokes (at all), 0=non smoker
	this type of coding is useful in later atages of analysis


coding: attaching labels to values
	many analysis software packages allow you to attach a label to the variables values
		eg: label 0's as non smoker and 1's as smoker
	makes reading data output easier:
		without label: variable smoke  frequency  percent
				0		21	   60%
				1		14	   40%

		with label:    variable smoke  frequency  percent
				non-smoker	21	   60%
				smoker		14	   40%


coding - ordinal variables
	similar to other categorical variables
	eg: variable education, possible coding:
		0=did not graduate from high school
		1=high school graduate
		2=some college or post-high school education
		3=college graduate
	could be coded in reverse order
	for this ordinal categorical variable we want to be consistent with numbering because the value of the code assigned has significance
	eg: bad coding
		0=some college or post-high school education
		1=high school graduate
		2=college graduate
		3=did not graduate from high school
	data has an inherent order but coding does not follow that order - not appropiate coding for an ordinal categorical variable


coding - nominal variables
	order makes no difference
	eg: variable reside
		1=northeast
		2=south
		3=northwest
		4=midwest
		5=southwest


coding - continuous variables
	creating categories from a continuous variable (eg: age) is common
	may break down a continuous variable into chosen categories by creating an ordinal categorical variable
	eg: variable = agecat
		1=0-9 years old
		2=10-19 years old
		3=20-39 years old
		4=40-59 years old
		5=60 years orolder
	may need to code responses from fill in-the-blank and open-ended questions
	one approach is to group together responses with similar themes
	also need to code for the "don't know" response - typically coded as 9


coding tip
	though you do not code until the data is gathered, you should thinkabout how you are going to code while designing your questionnaire, before you gather any data.
	this will help you to collect the data in a format you can use


data cleaning
	one of the first steps in analysing data is to "clean" it of any obvious data entry errors:
		outliers? (really high or low numbers)
		value entered that doesn't exist for variable
		missing values
	may be able to set defined limits when entering data - prevents entering a 2 when only 1,0 or missing are acceptable values
	limits can be set for continuous and nominal variables
		eg: only allowing 3 digits for age, limiting words that can be entered, assigning field types (eg: formatting dates as dd/mm/yyyy)
	many data entry systems allow "double-entry" - eg: entering the data twice and then comparing both entries for discrepancies
	univariate data analysis is a useful way to check the quality of the data


why is data preprocessing important?
	no quality data, no quality mining results
		quality decisions must be based on quality data: duplicate or missing data may cause incorrect or even misleading statistics
	data preparation, cleaning and transformation comprises the majority of the work in a data analytics application (90%)
